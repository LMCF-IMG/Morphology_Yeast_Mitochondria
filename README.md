# Morphology_Yeast_Mitochondria
Analysis of morphology of *mitochondria* in images acquired by a widefield fluorescence microscope (WF) to distinguish differences between controls (both wild and treated) and the experiment (both wild and treated as well).

**Macro for [ImageJ/Fiji](https://fiji.sc/).**

### Short description

As inputs the macro takes two images: 1. DIC image of yeast cells; 2. the corresponding fluorescence image of mitochondria of the same field of view.

A microscope used for the acquisition of both modalities: Olympus IX-71 inverted microscope with a 100x PlanApochromat objective (NA 1.4), GFP filter block exc. max.488, em. max. 507, Nomarski Differential Interference Contrast (DIC).
