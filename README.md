# Morphology_Yeast_Mitochondria
Analysis of morphology of healthy and treated *mitochondria* in images acquired by a widefield fluorescence microscope (WF) to distinguish differences between controls (both wild and treated) and the experiment (both wild and treated as well). The analysis was done with and the pictures were created and provided by Dr. Jana Vojtov√°, [Laboratory of Cell Reproduction, Institute of Microbiology of the Czech Academy of Sciences, Prague, Czech Republic](https://mbucas.cz/en/research/biology-of-the-cell-and-bioinformatics/laboratory-of-cell-reproduction/))

**Macro for [ImageJ/Fiji](https://fiji.sc/).**

### Short description

As inputs the macro takes two images: 1. DIC image of yeast cells; 2. the corresponding fluorescence image of mitochondria of the same field of view. 

A microscope used for the acquisition of both modalities: Olympus IX-71 inverted microscope with a 100x PlanApochromat objective (NA 1.4), GFP filter block exc. max.488, em. max. 507, Nomarski Differential Interference Contrast (DIC).
